# Vulnerability Assesment and Scanning

- A vulnerability assessment is the process of defining, identifying, classifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities in computer systems, applications and network infrastructures.

- Provides necessary knowledge, awareness and risk backgrounds to understand and react to threats to their environment.

- Intends to identify threats and the risks they pose. It typically involves using automated testing tools, such as different typ of scanners (.e.g. host based, network based, web app based etc), whose results are listed in a vulnerability assessment report. 

## How does it work? Key features:
1. Systematic Scanning - Identifies vulnerabilities such as: outdated software, misconfigurations, or missing patches.
Uses databases of known vulnerabilities to match detected issues.
2. Risk Classification - Classifies by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on their potential impact with often integration with scoring systems like CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System).
3. Automated - It's being implemented through automated tools like OpenVAS or Nessus.
4. Reporting - Generates reports with potential recommendations for fixing.

## How does it differ from Penetration Testing (PT)?
VA checks whether a vulnerability exists and PT tries to prove that exploiting a vulnerability can damage the system. So it does not attempt to exploit vulnerabilities but focuses on creating an inventory of risks and providing recommendations for remediation.

## Databases of known vulnerabilities
### CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
Globally recognized system for identifying and naming security vulnerabilities. Which is currently standard in IT industry. Managed by the MITRE Corporation. It provides:
- consistent formatting: like ```CVE-YEAR-XXX``` like ```"YEAR"``` indicates when the vulnerability was disclosed, and ```"XXXX"``` is a unique identifier.
- purpose: simplifies vulns tracking across systems and tools, because of standarization. Links to detailed information in vulnerability databases like NVD (National Vulnerability Database).
- Widely integrated into many tools (scanners).

### Other
- NVD (National Vulnerability Database): Managed by U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
- Exploit Database (ExploitDB): Managed by Offensive Security.
- VulnDB: Managed by Risk Based Security.
- SecurityFocus (Bugtraq): Managed by Broadcom.
- CERT Vulnerability Notes Database: Managed by CERT Coordination Center (Carnegie Mellon University).
- OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities): Managed by Google.
- Vendor-Specific Databases: like Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), Cisco PSIRT (Product Security Incident Response Team) or Red Hat CVE Database.

## What is CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)?
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a standardized framework used to evaluate the severity of security vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and systems.

- Key Metrics:
    + Attack Vector (AV): How the vulnerability can be exploited (e.g., network, adjacent network, local, physical).
    + Attack Complexity (AC): The complexity of exploiting the vulnerability (e.g., low or high).
    + Privileges Required (PR): The level of access needed to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., none, low, high).
    + User Interaction (UI): Whether user involvement is required (e.g., none or required).
    + Scope (S): Whether the vulnerability affects resources beyond its own security scope (e.g., unchanged or changed).
    + Impact Metrics: Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) impacts.

- CVSS provides a numerical score ranging from 0.0 to 10.0, which indicates the level of risk associated with a vulnerability:  
    | Numerical Score | Severity Level|
    |----------|:-------------:|
    | 0.0 |  None |
    | 0.1 - 3.9 | Low |
    | 4.0 - 6.9 | Medium |
    | 7.0 - 8.9 | High |
    | 9.0 - 10.0 | Critical |
This score is often accompanied by a qualitative rating (None, Low, Medium, High, Critical in CVSS standard) to make it easier to interpret.

> Security scanners like Nessus and OpenVAS use CVSS scores in their reports.
