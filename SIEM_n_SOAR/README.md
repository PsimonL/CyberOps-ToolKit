# SIEM and SOAR

SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It is a type of software solution that provides centralized monitoring, analysis, and management of security-related data from across an organizationâ€™s IT infrastructure. SIEM solutions collect logs and events generated by devices, applications, and systems to detect and respond to security threats in real time.

Key Features of SIEM:
- Log Collection and Aggregation:
- Threat Detection:
- Incident Response:
- Compliance Management:
- Dashboards and Visualization:

Examples of SIEM Tools:
- Splunk Enterprise Security
- IBM QRadar
- Wazuh (as part of its integration with the ELK stack)
- ArcSight
- LogRhythm


SOAR stands for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response. It is a type of platform designed to help security teams manage and automate their incident response workflows, enabling faster and more effective handling of security events.

While SIEM detects threats by analyzing logs and events, SOAR takes action on these threats by automating the response. For example:

SIEM Detects: A SIEM solution identifies a suspicious login attempt and raises an alert.  
SOAR Responds: The SOAR system automatically blocks the IP, opens a ticket in the IT system, and notifies the security team.
