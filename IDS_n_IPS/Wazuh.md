# Wazuh
A comprehensive platform for security monitoring (Security Information and Event Management, SIEM) and threat management.

Composed of three main components:
- Agents installed on hosts (collect logs, monitor files, and detect intrusions).
- Central server, where data is processed (logs and events are sent to the Wazuh server, where analysis and correlation occur).
- Dashboard (Kibana) for data visualization and analysis (provides real-time visualization of data, including alerts, compliance reports, and system status).

Analyzes system logs, network traffic, security events, and incidents in real-time.
Integrates with other solutions (e.g., Elastic Stack, public clouds).
