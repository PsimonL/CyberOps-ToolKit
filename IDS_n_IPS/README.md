# IDS and IPS

- IDS (Intrusion Detection System):  
It refers to a set of tools and best practices for computer systems to detect malicious activities or security policy violations. It helps in identifying potential threats by monitoring traffic and notifying administrators about necessary actions through appropriate alerts. However, it does not take any actions to block malicious traffic. It operates completely passively in real-time mode.

- IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):  
This is a system designed to prevent intrusions in information systems. It is a direct extension of the IDS concept. It takes steps to block unwanted actions. It operates actively in real-time mode.

Both IDS and IPS can perform a technique called DPI (Deep Packet Inspection), which involves inspecting the entire data packet (not just the header but also its content) to identify potential threats.

There are several types of IDS/IPS systems, but the two most popular are:
- Network Detection / Prevention System
- Host-based Detection / Prevention System
