# Identity and Access Management
IAM is a framework of policies and technologies to ensure that the right users (that are part of the ecosystem connected to or within an enterprise) have the appropriate access to technology resources.
Main functions of IAMs:
1. Identify users and devices (who/what they are).
2. Authenticate them (validate their identity).
3. Authorize their access to resources based on roles, policies, and permissions.
