# Infrastructure and System Penetration Testing
A simulated attack on a system's infrastructure, including servers, routers, overall endpoints, databases, and networks, to uncover vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

## Workflow 
1. Reconnaissance: Gather information about the target (e.g., with Nmap, Recon-ng).
2. Scanning: Identify active hosts, open ports, and services.
3. Exploitation: Exploit vulnerabilities using tools like Metasploit or custom scripts.
4. Post-Exploitation: Maintain access, escalate privileges, and simulate real-world threats.
5. Reporting: Document findings, vulnerabilities, and remediation strategies.

## How to pentest a server?
1. Planning, knowledge and resources gathering: 
- Define what servers will be tested (e.g., web servers, database servers).
- Identify the testing type:
    + External Pentesting: Testing servers from outside the network - an attacker point of view.
    + Internal Pentesting: Testing servers from within the network - an insider threat.

2. Reconnaissance and Information Gathering:
- Use tools to gather information about the server itself:
    + Open ports
    + Running services (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH)
    + Server software versions
    + DNS records

3. Vulnerability Identification:
- Scan the server for vulnerabilities, including:
    + Misconfigurations (e.g., weak SSH settings)
    + Outdated software with known vulnerabilities
    + Open ports that should be closed

4. Exploitation
- Found vulnerabilities can lead to an attempt of using them to gain access to sensitive data or privileges, so called "exploitation":
    + Brute-forcing login credentials
    + Exploiting weak encryption protocols
    + Exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities

5. Post-Exploitation
- Analyze the potential impact, if attack was successful.
- Identify sensitive assets accessible through the server.

6. Reporting
- Document vulnerabilities found, how they were exploited, and how to fix them steps.
- Provide recommendations for patching and hardening that particular server.

## Tools
- Nmap, Netcat (Reconnaissance tools)
- Nessus, OpenVAS (Vulnerability Scanning tools)
- Metasploit (Exploitation tool)
- Hydra, John The Ripper (Exploitation tools)
- Network Analysis: Wireshark, tcpdump
- Specific tools like: Sqlmap (SQL related) or Nikito (web servers)
